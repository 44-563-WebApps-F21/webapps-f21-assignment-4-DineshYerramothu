<p class="speech">Yes—who has called?</p>
<br>

<h6 class="name Parker">PARKER</h6>   
<p class="speech">Lord Darlington, my lady.</p> 
<br>

<br>

<h6 class="name Parker">PARKER</h6>

<br>

<h6 class="name LADY-WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE</h6>  
<p class="speech">It’s best for me to see him before to-night.  I’m glad he’s come.</p>

<p class="speech">Lord Darlington,</p>
<br>


<h6 class="LORD-DARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON </h6> 
<p class="speech">How do you do, Lady Windermere? </p>
<br>

<h6 class="name LADY-WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE</h6> 
<p class="speech">How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.</p> 
<br>

<h6 class="LORD-DARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON </h6>    
<p class="speech">They are quite perfect. 
<p class="stage-direction" >[_Sees a fan lying on the table_.]</p>  
<p class="speech"> And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it? </p>

<br>

<h6 class="name LADY-WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE</h6>  
<p class="speech">Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?</p>
<br>

<h6 class="LORD-DARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON </h6> 
<p class="speech">No?  Is it really?</p>
 <br>

<h6 class="name LADY-WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE</h6>
<p class="speech">Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit down. </p> 
<p class="stage-direction">[_Still arranging flowers_.]</p>
<br>

<h6 class="LORD-DARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON </h6> 
<p class="stage-direction">[_Sitting down_.]</p> 
<p class="speech">I wish I had known it was your birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for you.</p>  
<br>


<h6 class="name LADY-WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE</h6> 
<p class="speech">Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.</p>
<br>

<h6 class="LORD-DARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON </h6>  
<p class="speech">I, Lady Windermere?</p>   
<br>


<h6 class="name LADY-WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE</h6> 
<p class="speech">Put it there, Parker.  That will do.  
<p class="stage-direction">[_Wipes her hands with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]</p> 
<p class="speech">Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?</p> </p>
<br>


<h6 class="LORD-DARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON </h6> 
<p class="stage-direction">[_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]</p> 
<p class="speech">I am quite miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.</p> 
<p class="stage-direction">[_Sits down at table L._]</p> 
<br>

<h6 class="name LADY-WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE</h6>
<p class="speech">Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the whole evening.</p>
