<h6>PARKER</h6> 
<p> Is your ladyship at home this afternoon?</p>
<br>

<h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6>  
<p>Yes—who has called?</p>
<br>

<h6>PARKER</h6>  
<p>Lord Darlington, my lady.</p> 
<br>

<h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6> 
<p>[_Hesitates for a moment_.]</p>  
<p>Show him up—and I’m at home to any one who calls.</p>
<br>

<h6>PARKER</h6>  
<p>Yes, my lady.</p>
<br>

<h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6> 
<p>It’s best for me to see him before to-night.  I’m glad he’s come.</p> 
<br>

<h6>PARKER</h6>   
<p>Lord Darlington,</p>
<br>


<h6>LORD DARLINGTON. </h6> 
<p>How do you do, Lady Windermere? </p>
<br>

<h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6>   How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.<br>

<h6>LORD DARLINGTON. </h6>   They are quite perfect.  [_Sees a fan lying on the
table_.]  And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it? <br>

<h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6>   Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday? <br>

<h6>LORD DARLINGTON. </h6>   No?  Is it really? <br>

<h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6>  Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
down.  [_Still arranging flowers_.] <br>

<h6>LORD DARLINGTON. </h6> 
<p>[_Sitting down_.]</p> 
<p>I wish I had known it was your birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for you.</p>  
<br>


<h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6>   
<p>Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.</p>
<br>

<h6>LORD DARLINGTON. </h6> 
<p>I, Lady Windermere?</p>   
<br>


<h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6>  
<p>Put it there, Parker.  That will do.  
<p>[_Wipes her hands with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]</p> 
<p>Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?</p> </p>
<br>


<h6>LORD DARLINGTON. </h6> 
<p>[_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]</p> 
<p>I am quite miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.</p> 
<p>[_Sits down at table L._]</p> 
<br>

<h6>LADY WINDERMERE</h6>  
<p>Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the whole evening.</p> 
<br>
